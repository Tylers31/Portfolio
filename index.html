                <h3>Find the Simpsons</h3>
                <p>On this project, I was a developer for a few of their updates that the owner pushed. I helped out with various different tasks, including: Bug fixes, programming new content, and reprogramming previous code.</p>
                <p><em>Visit Count: 100m+</em></p>

            <h3>RNG Tycoon</h3>
            <p>This project was a Tycoon style game with the implementation of the popular RNG logic. The game did alright, but the player count has died down a lot since it peaked.</p>
            <p><em>Visit Count: 35,000+</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>Anonymous Expedition</h3>
            <p>Anonymous Expedition was another horror game that I led development on. The game released and did alright, but it never ended up blowing up and having a large player base.</p>
            <p><em>Visit Count: 5,000+</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>The Project</h3>
            <p>This was an older project that I led development on. It was a high-quality recreation of The Backrooms in Roblox. It was an innovative game, however it never officially released due to the owner having a lack of motivation for it.</p>
            <p><em>Visit Count: 2,500</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>Can't Sleep?</h3>
            <p>Can't Sleep was a side project I was working on about a year ago, which I never ended up fully completing. It was a realistic horror game about sleep paralysis.</p>
            <p><em>Visit Count: N/A</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>Weapons+</h3>
            <p>Weapons+ is a weapon system that I programmed from the ground up. It includes guns, melee weapons, and some custom abilities. I released it, however I do not maintain it anymore.</p>
            <p><em>Purchases: 100+</em></p>
